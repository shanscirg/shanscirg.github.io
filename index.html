      <p>I am a future web developer! My background is in the language education field. I have an MA in Teaching Spanish and a certification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. I'm looking to hopefully combine my background in language education with my new career path of programming. I love to travel and meet new people from different walks of life! In my free time, you can catch me studying astrology, singing and dancing very poorly, or playing cards with my nana.</p>
